# MuleSoft DataWeave Practice

This repository marks the start of my New Year commitment to practice DataWeave daily
using real-world MuleSoft integration scenarios.

## Purpose
- Strengthen functional thinking in DataWeave
- Practice clean and readable transformations
- Document learnings with input and output examples
- Build a reusable reference for interviews and real projects

## Structure
Each folder represents a single use case and contains:
- input.json
- transform.dwl
- output.json

## Goal
One meaningful DataWeave use case per day, focused on clarity,
business intent, and best practices.

Happy New Year 🎉
